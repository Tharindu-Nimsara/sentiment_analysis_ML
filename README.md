# sentiment_analysis_ML
Machine learning project for AI module group project

This project uses a Machine learning model to predict the postivity or the negativity of a customer review. This consist of a ML model made using logistic regression. Also I have included a feature to get a summary of all customer reivews by uploading them to openAI gpt-4o model and getting a summary as the response. Here I have used openAI free model which I have got from github market place. The api key expires within 30 days. Key created on sep 8 2025.
